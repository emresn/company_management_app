**Models CASCADE or ...**
`CASCADE` : When the referenced object is deleted, also delete the objects that have references to it (when you remove a blog post for instance, you might want to delete comments as well). SQL equivalent: CASCADE.
`PROTECT` Forbid the deletion of the referenced object. To delete it you will have to delete all objects that reference it manually. SQL equivalent: RESTRICT.
`RESTRICT`: (introduced in Django 3.1) Similar behavior as PROTECT that matches SQL's RESTRICT more accurately. (See django documentation example)
`SET_NULL` : Set the reference to NULL (requires the field to be nullable). For instance, when you delete a User, you might want to keep the comments he posted on blog posts, but say it was posted by an anonymous (or deleted) user. SQL equivalent: SET NULL.
`SET_DEFAULT` : Set the default value. SQL equivalent: SET DEFAULT.
`SET(...)` : Set a given value. This one is not part of the SQL standard and is entirely handled by Django.
`DO_NOTHING` : Probably a very bad idea since this would create integrity issues in your database (referencing an object that actually doesn't exist). SQL equivalent: NO ACTION.
